PBKDF2 now uses SHA-512 and 500,000 iterations (much stronger key derivation).

Salt length increased to 32 bytes.

Device fingerprint includes extra entropy (screen, colorDepth, locale, timezone, hardwareConcurrency).

Device-key derivation uses PBKDF2 (SHA-512) too.

When a user checks “Remember this device” the app key is wrapped with the device key and stored (IV prefixed).

Replaced eval with new Function(...)() to reduce surface for accidental use of eval.

Added lightweight anti-copy / anti-devtools hurdles (disable right-click, selection, common devtool shortcuts) — not foolproof but raises the bar.
